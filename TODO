IN THE SHORT TERM

Finish the instructions.

Make a setup.py that does something reasonable. Ideally it conforms to
   a standard, but I'd settle for something that works for the target
   audience, in the short term. Golly, I hope it's not too complicated.

Rename take_sample_data.py to something reasonable. Also clean it
   up. Make it nice and intuitive, e.g. have it wait for something
   more intuitive than C-d as an end condition.

Recommend that users not familiar with Linux add 'set -C' to their
   .bashrc file.

Make a wrapper script that hides the complex command-line
   flags. There's just no need for it to do anything more complicated
   than that.

Document the mathematical decisions underlying the circuit design. And
   also that one resistor that I chose arbitrarily while fixing the
   design "in the field."

Add labels to the circuit diagram, or wholly replace it with the
   labeled version.

Make unit tests. Learn how to use Mock for unit tests. All you should
   need to mock is the ADS1015 and that one GPIO pin. (I need to learn
   how to do this anyway.)

Add an MIT license. And maybe a huge disclaimer, like "this may break
   EVERYTHING but is not guaranteed to do so." ... I'm not an
   electrical engineer, folks.

IN THE MORE DISTANT FUTURE (i.e. probably never, but I recommend
   taking these steps to any programmer who continues my project.)

Make this whole program work with some kind of USB-to-I2C or
   USB-to-GPIO device so that people don't need to use a raspberry pi
   at all.
